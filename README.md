This repo holds aftifacts useful for a homelab based on using a vSphere hypervisor to host variaous services and workload. A few baseline components that need physical IO or need to begin operation quickly after a power fail restart are on bare metal or in VMs. The remainder are hosted on Kubernetes.

As a disclaimer, author(s) of this material may be employed by VMware, but this is a personal repo that should not be considered to be supported or recommended by VMware. Material here exists to eduacate and share with a homelab community. Methods and code are examples that are general in nature and suited for a homelab rather that a commercial production environment. Your exact circumstances might differ to such a degree that the items offered here need modification or are inappropriate.
